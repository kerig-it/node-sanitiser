# Security Policy

_Last updated May 24, 2022_

This security policy (the &#8220;Policy&#8221;) constitutes a non-legally binding agreement made between you and Kerig OÃœ, doing business as Kerig (&#8220;we,&#8221; &#8220;our&#8221;). The realm of the Policy&#8217;s applicability only extends to the boundaries of [the `node-sanitiser` repository](https://github.com/kerig-it/sanitiser) (the &#8220;Repository&#8221;). The intention thereof is to inform you about ways of reporting security vulnerabilities that collectively damage, harm, or otherwise diminish the safety of any users of software that utilises any code from the Repository or other vulnerabilities that otherwise relate thereto that you discovered within the Repository&#8217;s code.

Prior to reporting any vulnerabilities, we suggest you check the Repository&#8217;s release support for security updates.

## Releases Supported for Security Updates

Pre-releases not meant for use in production deployment are listed separately.

|Release tag|Supported|
|---|---|
|0.0.x (Current)|Yes|
|0.0.0-beta.x|No|
|0.0.0-alpha.x|No|

Any pre-release will cease support for security updates when its succeeding release or pre-release is published. Releases meant for use in production environments are always subject to security updates if necessary unless there is a specific reason for that not to be the case.<!--  A concise explanation of such lack of support, if present, can be found below. -->

## Reporting a Security Vulnerability

Withal GitHub issues being certes an excellent medium anent improving our software, we ask you to avoid publicly reporting any and all security vulnerabilities within our open source software. That implies avoiding reporting security vulnerabilities per issue filing on the Repository on GitHub.

Hereby and until further notice, the only appropriate way for you to report security vulnerabilities is by sending an e-mail to <security@kerig.ee>. Depending on the severity level, we will do everything within our capacity to implement the security patch in the next public release. If you have further questions or need support, you can [file your question](https://github.com/kerig-it/node-sanitiser/issues/new/choose) or [search through our FAQ](https://support.kerig.ee).
