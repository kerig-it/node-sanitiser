# Security Policy

**Last revised: 2022-03-25**

This is the security policy of [the `sanitiser` repository](https://github.com/kerig-it/sanitiser). Its intend is to inform you on how to report security vulnerabilities that might be discovered within the code of this repository.

Before proceeding reporting the vulnerability, though, please find out below what versions of this repository are supported for security updates.

# Supported Versions

|Version|Supported|
|---|---|
|0.0.x (Current)|Yes|
|0.0.0-beta.x|No|
|0.0.0-alpha.x|No|

In general, any pre-release will cease support for security updates as soon as its successorial release or pre-release is published. Releases meant for use in production environments are usually always subject for security updates may there be a necessity, unless there's a specific reason for that to not to be the case. A concise explanation of such lack of support, in case present, can be found below.
